# Browser-Based

## Arcade

### Shortlist
* [Alge's Escapade](https://github.com/Dave-and-Mike/game-off-2012) - HTML5, JavaScript, GameJs arcade game where you control an Algae. [Play it now!](http://dave-and-mike.github.io/game-off-2012/)
    - no timing required, clone to solve problems
    - controls: left, right, jump, clone, tab between clones. jumping shouldn't need to be too precise. Only ~4 levels. Ah. Would need to design new levels
    - Bug: breaks if you leave tab. No license.
* [Heal 'em All](https://github.com/krzysu/game-off-2013) - Imagine, what if the cure exists? What if zombies plague can be stoped? Explore old, abandoned graveyard, heal as many zombies as you can, and find your way out. But be careful not to become one of them. [Play it now!](http://games.myviews.pl/heal-em-all/)
* [HexGL](https://github.com/BKcore/HexGL) - Futuristic HTML5 racing game by Thibaut Despoulain using HTML5, Javascript and WebGL. [Play it now!](http://hexgl.bkcore.com/)
* [Infectors](https://github.com/satanas/infectors) - Sokoban-like puzzle game developed with Phaser. [Play it now!](http://satanas.github.io/infectors/)
  - very nice simple puzzle game, just need arrows
* [Zoko](https://github.com/lulea/game-off-2012) - 3D version of Sokoban. [Play it now!](http://lulea.github.io/game-off-2012/)
- 3d sokoban puzzle
  
### Vertical scrolling space shooter
* [Alien Invasion](https://github.com/cykod/AlienInvasion) - Demo Game for Mobile HTML5 Game Development. [Play it now!](http://cykod.github.io/AlienInvasion/)
Works: move left, right, fire (vertical scroller)
* [FlxInvaders](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/Flx-Invaders) - Very simple Flixel game inspired by the Taito classic. [Play it now!](http://flixel.org/flxinvaders/)
Works: left, right, shoot 

### Breakout
* [Ball And Wall](https://github.com/budnix/ball-and-wall) - Pure JavaScript arkanoid style game. [Play it now!](http://ballandwall.com/)
Works: fairly snazzy 1-player breakout game. Left, right, release ball. 
* [Breakout](https://github.com/Couchfriends/breakout) - Breakout multiplayer with HTML5.
Live game link is dead, it's a multiplayer breakout which could be nice

### 'Flappy bird'
* [Pappu Pakia](https://github.com/mindd-it/pappu-pakia) - Addictive game where you guide little Pappu around obstacles while collecting coins, stars, and berries and avoiding enemies known as Pakias. [Play it now!](http://khele.in/pappu-pakia/)
- this is the nicest I've found, isn't too hard, has some bonus things to make interesting.
* [Captain Rogers](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Captain-Rogers) - Captain Rogers: Asteroid Belt of Sirius - HTML5 mobile game created using ImpactJS. [Play it now!](http://enclavegames.com/games/captain-rogers/)
Works: flappy bird game, click to go up/release to go down. Low res graphics. 
* [Clumsy Bird](https://github.com/ellisonleao/clumsy-bird) - Flappy Bird clone in JavaScript using MelonJS. [Play it now!](http://www.varunpant.com/static/resources/CrappyBird/index.html)
Meh, simple, a bit of a pain, jumpy.

### Vertical scroller
* [Jolly Jumper](https://github.com/shohan4556/jolly-jumper) - Made in Phaser. [Play it now!](http://shohan4556.github.io/jolly-jumper/)
Works: nice and simple, just move left/right.
* [Drill Bunny](https://github.com/DreamShowAdventures/LudumDare29) - Written in JavaScript and using the great Phaser library. [Play it now!](http://dreamshowadventures.github.io/LudumDare29/)
Quite a nice, forgiving, vertical scroller: collect things and avoid things. left/right only.
* [Octocat Jump](https://github.com/ogoshen/game-off-2012) - GitHub Game Off 2012 Entry. [Play it now!](http://ogoshen.github.io/game-off-2012/)
  - vertical jumper, simpler than jolly jumper, but some nice physics?

### Platformer
* [Codename Lumberjack](https://github.com/arkeus/Codename-Lumberjack) - Simple flash game written using Actionscript 3.0 and Flixel. [Play it now!](http://projects.iarke.us/codenamelumberjack/)
Works: nice demo of a platformer made with flixel, but not a complete game

### Puzzley(?)
* [Digger](https://github.com/lutzroeder/digger) - HTML5 version of a Boulderdash game.
Nothing time-sensitive [possibly slightly but that could be fixed], just need left/right/up/down, puzzle at your own pace.
* [Hyperspace Garbage Collector](https://github.com/razh/game-off-2013) - General Hyperspace Waste Management Solutions. [Play it now!](http://razh.github.io/game-off-2013/)
  - just 4-way steering plus single toggle, steer space debris into goal by solving puzzles. Quite simple, nice, but few levels.
* [Newton Adventure](https://github.com/devnewton/newton_adventure) - Play Newton, a very special hero who has the power to change gravity direction! [Play it now!](http://play.bci.im/newton_adventure/)
  - rotate gravity, requires fairly sensitive timing of controls, but could be do-able...

### Misc
* [Pop Pop Win](https://github.com/dart-lang/pop-pop-win) - Implementation of Minesweeper in Dart. [Play it now!](http://dart-lang.github.io/sample-pop_pop_win/)
  - nice graphics
* [Onslaught Arena](https://github.com/lostdecade/onslaught_arena) - Fight off hordes of classic medieval monsters in this fast paced arcade shooter! [Play it now!](http://arcade.lostdecadegames.com/onslaught_arena/)
quite nice simple shooter, small graphics, but requires shooting with extra control (might be hard to do with dwell)
* [Custom Tetris](https://github.com/ondras/custom-tetris) - Play the classic Tetris game the way you like it. [Play it now!](http://ondras.github.io/custom-tetris/)
Works: interesting (local) multiplayer, could be an intro to tetris for eye gaze player (you get to choose what blocks come next), or they can set up nasty problems for someone else.
* [CHANG€](https://github.com/RothschildGames/change) - Intense game about the extreme life of supermarket cashiers. [Play it now!](http://change-game.herokuapp.com/)
Works: weird but surprisingly fun, time limit is stressful. Probably not worth it. 


Other ideas (without source to hand):
- plasma pong (e.g. like this but more polished)
- logo programming 



### Meh, not really

* [Coil](https://github.com/leereilly/Coil) - HTML5 canvas game where you defeat enemies by wrapping enemies in your trail. [Play it now!](http://hakim.se/experiments/html5/coil/)
Probably not appropriate for gaze control
* [Grave Robbers](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/GraveRobbers) - Sort of GIRP-inspired tower defense. [Play it now!](http://adamatomic.com/graverobbers)
currently requires lots of keys, could be turned into dwell buttons, but probably requires timing. flash keeps freezing up.
* [HotFix](https://github.com/sdrdis/hotfix) - Help Hotfix collect stargazers and avoid enemies. Collect commits to upgrade hotfix and add new features. [Play it now!](http://sdrdis.github.com/hotfix/)
requires unity web player, can't get it working
* [hurry!](https://github.com/hughsk/ludum-dare-27) - Small but speedy arcade shooter. [Play it now!](http://hughsk.io/ludum-dare-27/)
WASD + jump + shoot, don't really get it, survive for as long as possible, probably requires speed
* [Jekyll & Hyde Collide](https://github.com/awesome-interactive/game-off-2013) - Multi-layered infinite side-scroller. [Play it now!](http://awesome-interactive.github.io/game-off-2013/ExportedGame.html) 
require UWP, haven't tried
* [JumpSuit](https://github.com/KordonBleu/jumpsuit) - a multiplayer space shooter set in a wrapped universe. [Play it now!](http://jumpsuit.space/)
  - servers are all dead, looks kind nice though
* [Mega Girl](https://github.com/ddionisio/game-off-2013) - Megaman inspired game. [Play it now!](http://www.renegadeware.com/web_games/megagirl/)
requires UWP, haven't tried.
* [Masonry JavaScript Tetris Clone](https://github.com/gamedolphin/Masonry-JavaScript-Tetris-Clone) - Tetris clone created using HTML5/JavaScript/Phaser.
  - link not live, could try code
* [Mode](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/Mode) - Small(but sadly not that simple) demo game built on the Flixel framework. [Play it now!](http://www.adamatomic.com/mode/)
  - stay alive, shoot things, need accurate jumping
* [PolyBranch](https://github.com/gbatha/PolyBranch) - Minimalist 3D game. Dodging branches may seem easy at first, but how long can you hold up as you approach terminal velocity? [Play it now!](http://gregbatha.com/branches/)
  - ha, my visual perception totally mis-parsed the tunnel here and it didn't make any sense. 
* [Protocol 390](https://github.com/josegallegos07/game-off-2013) - To survive in People's Park, you must supply the prophet with change.
 - simple platformer, I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do with it...
* [Raging Gardens](https://github.com/petarov/game-off-2012) - Javascript/HTML5 web browser game where a hungry (ninja) rabbit farts too often.
- meh, slightly glitchy, not really sure how long it can entertain, farting isn't that fun
* [BrowserQuest](https://github.com/mozilla/BrowserQuest) - HTML5/JavaScript multiplayer game experiment. [Play it now!](http://browserquest.mozilla.org/)
- got stuck loading, meh

## FPS

* [BananaBread](https://github.com/kripken/BananaBread) - Port of the Cube 2/Sauerbraten 3D game engine/first person shooter to the web, compiling C++ and OpenGL to JavaScript and WebGL using Emscripten. [Play it now!](https://kripken.github.io/BananaBread/cube2/bb.html)
this would make an okay testing ground for FPS interactions, would presumably need extra input for shooting (not just dwell)

## Strategy
* [Ancient Beast](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast) - Materialize and control beasts in order to defeat your opponents! [Play it now!](http://ancientbeast.com/play)
  - not my bag, looks fiddly

I really like this! but not sure how eye-gazeable it would be...
